### Screen recording setup ###
Recording the screen can in Qubes OS be done on three different levels.

This is just a quick sketch, more will be updated in the future.

- Browser plugin recording
Least reliable, but is also the most straight forward solution.

- VM-screen recording
More reliable, preferably the best solution if windows can be adjusted correctly.

- dom0 recording
Most reliable, but is also the discouraged due to dom0 security implications, and also includes the window adjustment difficulties as with VM-screen recording.
